        <h2>A brief history of Bangladesh Railway</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Bangladesh Railways is a government-owned and government-run transport company in the country. Bangladesh Railway has a total route of 2955.53 km with a total of 25063 regular employees. Since railways are an important means of land transportation to connect one end of the country with the other, the overall development of railways plays an important role in the economic development of the country. <br>

            Until 1982, the management and development of railways was entrusted to the Railway Board with a chairman and four members. Then for the convenience of administration and operation the Railway Board was abolished on 3 June 1982 and the activities of the Railway Board were entrusted to the Railway Division of the Ministry of Communications and the Secretary of that department acted as the Director General of Bangladesh Railway. For the same purpose, under the administrative control of two general managers, Bangladesh Railway was divided into two regions, East and West. Two general managers of the two regions are responsible to the director general of Bangladesh Railway. Subsequently, on 12 August 1995, the day-to-day operations of the Railways were separated from the Ministry and handed over to the Director General along with the Railway Professionals. The 9-member Bangladesh Railway Authority (BRA) was formed with the Minister of Communications as the Chairman to decide the policy. Additional Director Generals and Joint Directors General are all. <br>
            
            The general managers of the two zones are assisted by various specialized departments, which are responsible for operations, maintenance and financial management. Each zone is further divided into two main operations departments. These departments are managed under the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) and are assisted by Divisional Officers from various specialized departments like Installation, Transport, Commercial, Architectural, Mechanical, Way and Works, Signaling and Telecommunications, Electrical, Medical, Security Forces. There is also a workshop at Pahartali in the east and Syedpur in the west under two Divisional Superintendents. In addition, there is a locomotive factory under the control of Parbatipur Chief Executive for general overhauling of broad gauge and meter gauge locomotives.
            <br>
            For coordination and consultation of 'Railway Training Academy (RTA)' under Rector, 'Planning Cell' under Chief Planning Officer, 'Stores Department' under Chief Equipment Control, Accounting and financial management activities of two zones. There is an 'Accounts Department' under the Additional Director General (Finance). <br>
            
            To inspect the various activities of Bangladesh Railways related to train operation and to ensure the safety of rail transport, the Government of Bangladesh first formed a separate Railway Department under the Ministry of Communications and later the Ministry of Railways. <br>
